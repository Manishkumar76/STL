/*                           Introduction to STL
           
The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes and functions to provide common programming using data structures and functions 
such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. STL is a library consisting of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. It is a generalized library and so, 
its components are parameterized. A working knowledge of template classes is a prerequisite for working with STL.STL is an acronym for standard 
template library. It is a set of C++ template classes that provide generic classes and function that can be used to implement data structures and 
algorithms .STL is mainly composed of :
Components of STL--->
                     1. Containers-->
                                     Stores data/ use templates--> 
                                                                  vector,map,list,stack and queue etc.
                     2. Algorithms-->
                                     sorting, searching and use template functions etc. 
                     3. Iterators-->
                                    objects points to an element in a container.
                                    handled just like pointers.
                                    connets algorithums with containers.


Containers-->
             Container is an object which stores data. We have different containers having their own benefits.
             These are the implemented template classes for our use, which can be used just by including this library.
             You can even customise these template classes.


             Types of Containers-->
                                  1. Seuence Containers
                                  2. Associative containers
                                  3. Derived containers
            1.                       
                                   
Algorithms-->
             Algorithms are a set of instructions which manipulates the input data to arrive at some desired result. In STL, we have 
             already written algorithms, for example, to sort some data structure, or search some element in an array. These algorithms
             use template functions. 

Iterators-->
             Iterators are objects which refer to an element in a container. And we handle them very much similarly to a pointer. Their basic job is 
             to connect algorithms to the container and play a vital role in manipulation of the data.              
             Iâ€™ll give you a quick illustration of how they work combinedly.
